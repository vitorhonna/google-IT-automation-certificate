# GIT Cheatsheet

- `diff`: diff is used to find differences between two files. 
- `diff -u`: diff -u is used to compare two files, line by line, and have the differing lines compared side-by-side in the same output -> `diff -u menu1.txt menu2.txt`

```
~$ cat menu1.txt 
Menu1:

Apples
Bananas
Oranges
Pears

~$ cat menu2.txt 
Menu:

Apples
Bananas
Grapes
Strawberries

~$ diff -u menu1.txt menu2.txt

- `patch`: useful for applying file differences -> `patch < hello_world.diff`

```
~$ cat hello_world.txt 
Hello World
~$ cat hello_world_long.txt 
Hello World

- `git commit -a`: Stages files automatically
- `git log -p`: Produces patch text
- `git show`: Shows various objects
- `git diff`: Is similar to the Linux `diff` command, and can show the differences in various commits
- `git diff --staged`: An alias to --cached, this will show all staged files compared to the named commit
- `git add -p`: Allows a user to interactively review patches to add to the current commit
- `git mv`: Similar to the Linux `mv` command, this moves a file
- `git rm`: Similar to the Linux `rm` command, this deletes, or removes a file
- `git checkout`: is effectively used to switch branches.
- `git reset`: basically resets the repo, throwing away some changes.
- `git commit --amend`: is used to make changes to commits after-the-fact, which can be useful for making notes about a given commit.
- `git revert`: makes a new commit which effectively rolls back a previous commit. Itâ€™s a bit like an undo command.
- `git branch`: Used to manage branches
- `git branch <name>`: Creates the branch
- `git branch -d <name>`: Deletes the branch
- `git branch -D <name>`: Forcibly deletes the branch
- `git checkout <branch>`: Switches to a branch.
- `git checkout -b <branch>`: Creates a new branch and switches to it.
- `git merge <branch>`: Merge joins branches together. 
- `git merge --abort`: If there are merge conflicts (meaning files are incompatible), --abort can be used to abort the merge action.
- `git log --graph --oneline`: This shows a summarized view of the commit history for a repo.
